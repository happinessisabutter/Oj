# 2025-10-05 Backend Progress Summary

## Folder Layout
- API modules relocated to `backend/src/api/modules/*` with bootstrap moved to `backend/src/api/main.ts` to match the documented module structure while keeping the Nest entry point intact through `src/main.ts`.

## Problem & Quiz Services
- `ProblemService.findAll` now uses repository helpers (`findAndCount`, `ILike`) for search/pagination without explicit query builders.
- `QuizService.findAll` and `QuizService.findRecords` rely on repository calls with relation loading and normalized pagination defaults.

## Submissions Workflow
- New `SubmissionModule` surfaces REST endpoints (`POST /submissions`, `GET /submissions`, `GET /submissions/:id`, `/submissions/:id/cases`) with DTO validation and repository-driven persistence.
- `SubmissionService` enqueues judge tasks through a shared judge queue adapter and avoids TypeORM query builders for filters.

## Data Access Updates
- TypeORM datasource and seeder scripts updated to reference the new module paths so migrations/seeding continue to function after the folder move.

## Judge Workflow Skeleton
- Introduced `JudgeQueueModule` with an injectable in-memory queue that both the HTTP API and judge worker consume, keeping the loop/service skeleton functional without external dependencies.

## Documentation
- `backend/src/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` now includes a Problem & Quiz section reflecting the service changes and folder consolidation.
- `agentRead/updatingHistory/2025-10-05-quiz-modules-and-structure.md` logs the latest AI progress with the new paths and service behaviour.

## Follow-up
- Global lint still reports legacy issues in unrelated modules; rerun `npm run lint --workspace backend` after addressing the existing debt.
